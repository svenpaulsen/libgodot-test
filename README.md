# Test Project for LibGodot

A lightweight test application that embeds and runs the Godot Engine using `libgodot`. This is mainly intended for testing native embedding and GDExtension initialization.

## Usage

You **must** provide a project directory using:

```text
godot_test <project_path_or_pck>
```

All additional arguments are passed directly to the embedded Godot engine.
